NEWSIndy (North, East, West, South) will be a Asp.MVC web application for users in Indianapolis to see mutual aid resources and organizations in Indy.
Users will be able to narrow it down to the side of the city they’re in or narrow it down to boroughs. 

Users can also add organizations, 
Users will also have an option to volunteer at these organizations if they’d like to contribute to their communities. 

There will be a mutual aid support page where users can post messages about needing support,
and other users can come and help those users out if they’d like.

As well as there’ll be a local market place where users can share their art, music, etc and other users can come buy and support.
Also thinking of doing a services page/ section where users that are independent workers can offer up services.

I’d like to have an events section where users can add events and users can post messages to events and attend.
Would love to connect a bank account that anyone can donate to, and then people can withdrawl from it, even anonymously.
(thinking of foreign people without papers) but have some worries about that.
